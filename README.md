# Menu Example

An example showing how to implement a simple menu system in JUCE.

## Introduction

This example shows how to implement a simple menu system in JUCE. This is a simpler example than the JUCE demo application, which shows how to implement a more complex menu system.

## Building the Example

Open the JUCER file and press the "Save and Open in IDE" button to build the project.

## Key things to note

The `MainComponent` class implements the `MenuBarModel` interface, which is used to provide the menu items to the application. The `getMenuBarNames()` method returns the names of the menus, and the `getMenuItemsForMenu()` method returns the items for each menu. The `getMenuItemsForMenu()` method is also used to populate the menu bar at the top of the window.
You must use a std::unique_ptr for the MenuBarComponent and include the MenubarModel in the contructor of the Class that is using it. This will automatically call the method to populate the menu bar names.

```cpp
std::unique_ptr<MenuBarComponent> menuBar;
```

## Overrides

These are the three methods that must be overridden:

```cpp
    StringArray getMenuBarNames() override;
    PopupMenu getMenuForIndex(int topLevelMenuIndex, const String& /*menuName*/) override;
    void menuItemSelected(int menuItemID, int topLevelMenuIndex) override;
```

Once the object is created, the menu bar will be populated with the names returned by `getMenuBarNames()`. When the user selects a menu item, the `menuItemSelected()` method will be called with the ID of the selected item and the index of the menu that it was in.
